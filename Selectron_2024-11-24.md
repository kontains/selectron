## Selectron

The app in WebContainer appears to be a backend and frontend application built using;
  Rust, JavaScript, and TypeScript. 
  
  Here's a breakdown of its key components: This breakdown provides a comprehensive overview
 of the project structure and key components, formatted in GitHub Markdown for clarity and readability.

### Summary

The app appears to be a full-stack solution that combines backend and frontend logic,
 with IPC communication between them. It supports various features such as executing
 shell commands, managing databases, and handling user interactions through a web interface.
 The use of Rust for the backend suggests performance and safety benefits, while 
 TypeScript and JavaScript/TypeScript for the frontend provide modern development tools
 and better code organization.

### Backend (Rust)

### Main Entry Point (`src/main.rs`)
- **Purpose**: Initializes the application environment, sets up routing for different types of requests, and handles various commands.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `main()`: The entry point of the application.
  - `process_node_command()`: Handles node-related commands such as console logs, process information, file system operations, HTTP requests, child process management, and IPC communication.

### Node Addons (`src/node/addons/`)
- **Purpose**: Provides functionality for SQLite, SPDLog (a logging library), and PTY (pseudo-terminal) operations.
- **Key Modules**:
  - `sqlite.rs`: Manages SQLite database operations.
  - `spdlog.rs`: Handles logging using the SPDLog library.
  - `pty.rs`: Manages pseudo-terminal operations.

### IPC Handling (`src/node/ipc.rs`)
- **Purpose**: Manages inter-process communication (IPC) between different parts of the application.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `ipc_server()`: Creates an IPC server to handle incoming connections.
  - `ipc_connection()`: Handles individual IPC connections.

### Node Process Management (`src/node/process.rs`)
- **Purpose**: Handles spawning child processes, reading/writing to their stdin/stdout/stderr, and managing their lifecycle.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `child_process_spawn()`: Spawns a new child process and manages its communication channels.

### Types and Enums (`src/types.rs`)
- **Purpose**: Defines data structures and command types that are used throughout the application.
- **Key Structures**:
  - `Command`, `FrontendCommand`, `BackendCommand`: Define different types of commands for IPC, frontend, and backend operations.

### Frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript)

### Main Entry Point (`src/js/frontend/electrico.js`)
- **Purpose**: Initializes the frontend environment and sets up IPC communication with the backend.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `initscript()`: Initializes the frontend script and sets up event listeners.
  - Handles user interactions and communicates with the backend to perform various actions.

### Shared Utilities (`src/js/shared/require.js`, `src/js/shared/shared.js`)
- **Purpose**: Provides utility functions for loading modules, handling errors, and managing shared state.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `__init_require()`: Initializes module loading.
  - `__replaceImports()`: Replaces import statements with actual module code.

### Backend and Frontend Modules (`src/js/backend/`, `src/js/frontend/`)
- **Purpose**: Contains the actual implementation of the backend and frontend logic.
- **Key Files**:
  - `backend/package.json`, `frontend/package.json`: Define project dependencies.
  - Various JavaScript files for handling specific functionalities.

## Additional Files
- **Package Management**: The project uses npm to manage dependencies, so you'll need to run `npm install` to install all required packages.
- **Development Server**: The application is set up to use a development server (likely Vite or another similar tool) for running the frontend in development mode.

## Running the Project
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
